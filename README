SFContainerViewController is a UIViewController subclass that can have multiple UIViewController children. No memory problems, if this controller is not visible, it will unload its view and all of his children views.
From the children view you can use freely navigationController, parentViewController ( will point to container itself ), interfaceOrientation.

In children controllers you do not to handle special cases, or call special functions, 'it just works'.
